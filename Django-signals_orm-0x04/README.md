# Event Listeners (Signals), ORM & Advanced ORM Techniques

## Overview

In modern web applications, `performance`, `modularity`, and `clean architecture` are essential. Django provides powerful tools that help developers build robust and maintainable backend systems. Three core concepts that support these goals are:

## 1. Event Listeners using Django Signals

Signals allow decoupled parts of an application to communicate by emitting and listening to events. This enables actions like sending confirmation emails or logging activities whenever a specific model action (like saving or deleting) occursâ€”without tightly coupling that logic to your views or models.

## 2. Django ORM & Advanced ORM Techniques

Djangoâ€™s Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) enables developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL. It also provides advanced tools to optimize performanceâ€”like `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, and query annotationsâ€”helping avoid common issues like the N+1 query problem.

## 3. Basic Caching

Caching stores frequently accessed data so it can be retrieved faster. Django supports various caching strategies (view-level, template fragment, low-level caching), which can drastically reduce page load time and database load.

Together, these techniques improve **application responsiveness**, **database efficiency**, and **code scalability**, making them crucial tools for Django backend developers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain and implement Django **Signals** to build event-driven features.
- Use Django **ORM** to perform CRUD operations and write efficient queries.
- Apply **advanced ORM** techniques for optimizing database access.
- Implement **basic caching** strategies to enhance performance.
- Follow **best practices** to ensure maintainable, decoupled, and performant backend code.

## Learning Outcomes

You'll be able to:

- Use Django **Signals** to decouple side-effects from core business logic.
- Efficiently retrieve and manipulate database data using Django ORM.
- Avoid performance issues through query optimization techniques.
- Implement caching at the view, template, or data level to reduce server workload.
- Write clean and testable backend logic using Djangoâ€™s built-in tools.

## 1. Event Listeners Using Django Signals

### What are Signals?

Django **Signals** allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when specific actions have taken place. Theyâ€™re useful for triggering side effects like notifications, logging, or updates across different parts of your app.

#### Common Signals:

- `pre_save` / `post_save`
- `pre_delete` / `post_delete`
- `m2m_changed`
- `request_started` / `request_finished`

### Best Practices:

- Keep signal functions lean and avoid long-running tasks.
- Use the `@receiver` decorator to keep registration clean and explicit.
- Separate business logic from the signal handlerâ€”call a service or utility function.
- Disconnect signals during tests to prevent unwanted behavior.

## 2. Django ORM Basics

### ðŸ”§ What is ORM?

The **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** allows interaction with the database using Python models. You can query, insert, update, and delete records using intuitive syntax without writing raw SQL.

#### Common Operations:

- Create: `Model.objects.create(...)`
- Retrieve: `Model.objects.get(...)`, `.filter()`, `.all()`
- Update: `.save()`, `.update()`
- Delete: `.delete()`

### Best Practices:

- Always catch exceptions like `DoesNotExist` and `MultipleObjectsReturned`.
- Chain `.filter()` to narrow queries instead of retrieving all data.
- Validate data before saving.

### 3. Advanced ORM Techniques

#### Tools for Performance:

- `select_related()` â€“ for foreign key optimizations (JOINs).
- `prefetch_related()` â€“ for many-to-many or reverse foreign key optimizations.
- `annotate()` â€“ for aggregations like counts or sums.
- `Q()` and `F()` â€“ for complex queries and field-based calculations.
- **Custom Managers** â€“ to encapsulate and reuse query logic.

### Best Practices:

- Avoid repeated queries with eager loading.
- Use `only()` or `defer()` to limit unnecessary field loading.
- Profile complex queries using Django Debug Toolbar or `.query`.

## 4. Basic Caching in Django

### What is Caching?

**Caching** stores the result of expensive computations or database queries to avoid reprocessing. Django supports multiple levels of caching, including per-view, per-template-fragment, and manual (low-level) cache APIs.

### Common Tools:

- `@cache_page(60 * 15)` â€“ for view-level caching.
- `{% cache 300 "sidebar" %}` â€“ for template fragment caching.
- `cache.set(), cache.get()` â€“ low-level caching.

### Best Practices:

- Donâ€™t cache sensitive or user-specific data unless scoped properly.
- Use cache versioning and meaningful keys.
- Invalidate/update cache upon data changes using signals or explicit logic.

## Tasks

### 0. Implement Signals for User Notifications

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Automatically notify users when they receive a new message.

**Instructions**:

- Create a Message model with fields like sender, receiver, content, and timestamp.

- Use Django signals (e.g., post_save) to trigger a notification when a new Message instance is created.

- Create a Notification model to store notifications, linking it to the User and Message models.

- Write a signal that listens for new messages and automatically creates a notification for the receiving user.

- **GitHub repository**: **alx-backend-python**
- **Directory**: **Django-signals_orm-0x04**
- **File**: messaging/models.py, messaging/signals.py, messaging/apps.py, messaging/admin.py, messaging/tests.py

### 1. Create a Signal for Logging Message Edits

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Log when a user edits a message and save the old content before the edit.

**Instructions**:

- Add an edited field to the Message model to track if a message has been edited.

- Use the pre_save signal to log the old content of a message into a separate MessageHistory model before itâ€™s updated.

- Display the message edit history in the user interface, allowing users to view previous versions of their messages.

- **Directory**: **Django-signals_orm-0x04**
File: Django-Chat/Models

### 2. Use Signals for Deleting User-Related Data

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Automatically clean up related data when a user deletes their account.

**Instructions**:

- Create a delete_user view that allows a user to delete their account.

- Implement a post_delete signal on the User model to delete all messages, notifications, and message histories associated with the user.

- Ensure that foreign key constraints are respected during the deletion process by using CASCADE or custom signal logic.

### 3. Leverage Advanced ORM Techniques for Threaded Conversations

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Implement threaded conversations where users can reply to specific messages, and retrieve conversations efficiently.

**Instructions**:

- Modify the Message model to include a parent_message field (self-referential foreign key) to represent replies.

- Use prefetchrelated and selectrelated to optimize querying of messages and their replies, reducing the number of database queries.

- Implement a recursive query using Djangoâ€™s ORM to fetch all replies to a message and display them in a threaded format in the user interface.

### 4. Custom ORM Manager for Unread Messages

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Create a custom manager to filter unread messages for a user.

**Instructions**:

- Add a read boolean field to the Message model to indicate whether a message has been read.

- Implement a custom manager (e.g., UnreadMessagesManager) that filters unread messages for a specific user.

- Use this manager in your views to display only unread messages in a userâ€™s inbox.

- Optimize this query with .only() to retrieve only necessary fields.

### 5. implement basic view cache

**mandatory**
**Objective**: Set up basic caching for a view that retrieves messages in the messaging app.

**Instructions**:

- Update your settings.py in your messagingapp/messagingapp/settings.py with the default cache i.e django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache as follows:

```python
CACHES = { 'default': { 'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache', 'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake', } }
```

- Use `cache-page` in your views to cache the view that displays a list of messages in a conversation. Learn more about `cache-page` [here](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/caching/#using-cache-with-apiview-and-viewsets)

- Set a 60 seconds cache timeout on the view.
